# Farmer Information Platform

It is about developing farming process.
It is started to develop for the GDSC 2023 Solution Challenge.

## Getting Started

In our project, we bring together farmers and more experts in this business in one application, and we are working on solving the problems of farmers.

The name of the application is Farmer Information Platform. In this demo of the application for solving the problems of farmers, there is a home page where useful information is listed by the experts of the business for the user (farmer) side, and a question page where the farmers can ask the experts about their problems in production. On the admin side, there are pages to share information and answer questions. In addition, there is a profile page that is only for show and new features will be added later.

SDGs it can contribute to its solution: Goal 2: Zero Hunger, Goal 3: Good Health & Wellbeing, Goal 8: Decent Work & Economic Growth.

Technologies used in the application: Flutter, Dart, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)

(Since the application was developed in a limited period of 3-4 days, it has visible deficiencies, the codes belongs to the submitted version for the competition)
